Just recording the progress of my new year's resolution! Have a casual talk with one stranger in average every day. The goal is not talking to people everyday. (sometimes I would isolate myself for several days.) It’s to pursuit the final goal that 365 days would talk to 365 different persons! :laughing: 

平均每天和一个陌生人聊聊天，（注意不是每天都谈话哦，谁叫我这么悲哀有时候一编程就宅个好几天呢。）一年365天就有365个人啦！

**01-02**

1. `Ben`, from UK, the reception of gym room. "Is DJ part of your duty?" And he is not a student, serving for several gyms at the same time. He was laughing. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

**01-07**

2. `Andreea`, from Romania, from hacking club. We talked about the course, the professor, and the PhD paper. Have a hug! :laughing:

3. `Ian`, from Germany, a professor from a law school in Birmingham: A very clear-minded and performative guy. We talked about education, courages in job application, international students, deficit of British law, philosophy. A very big talk. :relieved:

4. `Ahmed`, from Iraq, and worked as a teacher in university in Iraq, now second year PhD student at UoB, having published three papers already! Had a very very good Buffet together at Five ways! Very good at algorithms! Laughs like Achim. And we both think Achim and Tom are so handsome that we want to cry! Talked about life, papers, algorithms, movies, Muslim religions! :relaxed:

**01-12**

5. `Bobbie`: from Indonesia. A Bham student in Health Science. Met her at the Learning Center for several times, so naturally exchanged contacts. :smiley:

**01-13**

6. `Zeana`: A girl from (阿拉伯国家，具体忘了T—T). Very beautiful and knowledgable. Explain things well! Had several chats during the lectures! :blush:

**01-15**

7. `Zully`: a CS girl from Ecuador. Very Q! She told me a lot about trip in Edinburgh, delicious food, (Cannot remember others but only Plaintain (芭蕉)), Snorkelling in the islands Galápagos Islands, climate in her countries! We had lunch, went to Network Sec and Aldi together. Q font as well! :yum:

8. `Ian`: Lecturer in Networks. Very knowledgable! 

**01-18**

In these two days I was playing around the `Ghost in the Shellcode 2015`, and happened to talk with people in the UoB hacking group through IRC channel. 

9. `Sam`: 久仰的大神⋯⋯三年學業成績排名全部第一。身上散髮一種淡定的大神氣息，淡淡的微笑常常能殺死人⋯⋯每次進房間都是他先說Hi，超級nice哈 :)Powerful, funny and friendly PhD students. Talked about hacking challenges, reverse engineering, undergrad and PhD projects, master applications etc.
