Just recording the progress of my new year's resolution! Have a casual talk with one stranger in average every day. The goal is not talking to people everyday. (sometimes I would isolate myself for several days.) It’s to pursuit the final goal that 365 days would talk to 365 different persons! :laughing: 

平均每天和一个陌生人聊聊天，（注意不是每天都谈话哦，谁叫我这么悲哀有时候一编程就宅个好几天呢。）一年365天就有365个人啦！

**01-02**

`Ben`, from UK, the reception of gym room. "Is DJ part of your duty?" And he is not a student, serving for several gyms at the same time. He was laughing. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

`Andreea`, from Romania, from hacking club. We talked about the course, the professor, and the PhD paper. Have a hug! :laughing:

`Ian`, from Germany, a professor from a law school in Birmingham: A very clear-minded and performative guy. We talked about education, courages in job application, international students, deficit of British law, philosophy. A very big talk. :relieved:

`Ahmed`, from Iraq, and worked as a teacher in university in Iraq, now second year PhD student at UoB, having published three papers already! Had a very very good Buffet together at Five ways! Very good at algorithms! Laughs like Achim. And we both think Achim and Tom are so handsome that we want to cry! Talked about life, papers, algorithms, movies, Muslim religions! :relaxed:
