I participated in the 4th Barcelona VPH summer school, 10-14 June 2019. Four hands-on workshops were available - and I chose **Machine learning and tissue modelling for image-guided brain surgery**, together with Mojtaba Barzegari, Marilisa Cortesi, DƒÅrta Maija Zake, and Qiao Li, under the guidance of Dr. Jerome Noailly and Dr. Mario Ceresa. In the end, we have won the Best Hands-On Award! 

This workshop provides us with an opportunity to solve two interesting problems in image-guided robotic brain surgeries - the first one being **robotic vision and control**, and the second being **brain tissue deformation modelling**.
