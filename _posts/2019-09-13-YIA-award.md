Itâ€™s my honor to be the winner of Rosanna Degani Young Investigator Award in the 2019 Computing in Cardiology Conference in Singapore! Many thanks to my supervisors, my coauthors, my lab LIRYC, my research network PIC, and the CinC committee!

The paper receiving awards is "Noninvasive One-Year Ablation Outcome Prediction for Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation Using Trajectories of Activation From Body Surface Potential Maps ". I will soon post the link to the final version.
