This month I am visiting the CEMRG of KCL, and it has been such a great learning experience with the group, especially Dr. Caroline Roney and Prof. Steven Niederer, who gave me many valuable inputs. 

My project in KCL includes modelling body surface potential map (BSPM) for atrial fibrillation, and study the effects of the heart / torso variability as well as atrial fibrosis on the patient P waves. 

Thank PIC for providing us with such a high-quality research network!
