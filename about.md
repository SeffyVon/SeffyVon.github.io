Hi! My name is Yingjing Feng. I am a Marie Curie H2020 ITN PhD fellow of `Personalised In-silico Cardiology (PIC)` project, based in LIRYC (The Electrophysiology and Heart Modeling Institute) in Bordeaux, France, under the supervision of Dr. Edward Vigmond. I obtained an MSc in Computing (Machine Learning) with Distinction from Imperial College London in 2016, with a Distinguished MSc Project (2015-2016) Prize, under the supervision of Dr. Su-Lin Lee. 

I am researching on the improve of `atrial fibrillation` treatment using non-invasive mapping method, using a joint approach of `machine learning` and `computational modelling`.  I am particularly interested in `Bayes deep learning`,  `decision making`, and `bio-medical signal processing`.

Before my PhD study, I was a software engineer in Bloomberg LP, where I also did some machine learning research and built the backend for large-scale trading data analysis, and did a summer internship as a technology analyst in JP Morgan, where I was developing an automatic testing suite for SWIFT messages using `Struts` Java framework and `Hibernate` database query. During my BSc in Computer Science degree in University of Birmingham, I was very much into `Computer Security` such as `Cryptogrphy`, `SQL Injection`, using `ADA`, `Wireshark`, `Burpsuite`, `JD-GUI`.
