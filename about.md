Aha! It's such a hard philosophical problem!

According to `Immanual Kant`. Could I even know who I am? 

I could just see the representation of myself! But I just spent a longer time with thing-of-myself than others did!

* Final-year student in  BSc in Computer Science in `University of Birmingham` and BEng Software Engineering in `Sun Yat-Sen University`!
